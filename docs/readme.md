##Introduction

This tools helps PoKémon trainers keep track of the Effort Values (or EVs for short) a specific PoKémon gains during its training period, achieving the desired EV spread.

There are many ways of gaining EVs. For now, we are only focusing on combats with hordes (with all the object combinations), vitamins and berrys.

Effort Values can have a huge impact on your Pokémon and the battles they participate in. EVs will let Swampert survive Hidden Power Grass, or will let Skarmory outspeed Magneton, and many other things. Having a proper EV spread (distribution of EVs on a Pokémon) can mean the difference between a win and a loss.


A total of **252 EV points can be put onto any one stat**, and a total of **510 points total can be given to any Pokémon**. However, it is important to note that a stat will only increase after every four EV points. In other words, putting 12 EVs and putting 15 EVs both result in the same thing: a 3 point increase to the stat.

EVs are hidden values related with a PoKémon and its stats. Some details about EVs:


* A PoKémon can have up to **510 EVs** assigned.
* Each EV is related with a stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed).
* Every four EVs on a stat, the PoKémon gains a point on it.

Now trainers want to have a specific EV spread for specific PoKémon. They usually start the training with **0 EVs** on each stat. If you're not starting with a freshly hatched Pokémon, you will probably need to reset its EVs with a Reset Bag first. 

Then, they focus on the stats they want to have highest EV count on. Given the 510 across limit, they usually limit it to 2 stats, so that'd be our default behaviour. So that means the most common EV spread is:

* 2 stats with 252 EVs = 504
* A third stat with remaining EVs (6), only worth ones = 4  
TOTAL = 508 EVs / 510 limit

The remaining 2 EVs are unused as they don't make a difference.

###Modifying EV gain

Basically, we can modify the way we gain EVs altering our Pokémon's status or attaching a boost item:

* **Pokérus** : Doubles EVs gained, can be combined with Macho Brace and Power Items
* ![Macho Brace](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/d/dc/Brazal_firme.png/revision/latest?cb=20090701100750)**Macho Brace** : Doubles Evs gained, halves the holder's Speed, can be combined with Pokérus
* **Power Items** : give 4 additional EV points to the corresponding stat, halves holder's Speed, can be combined with Pokérus
	* ![Power Weight](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/5/50/Pesa_recia.png/revision/latest?cb=20091010155052&format=webp) **Power Weight** : Adds +4 EVs in HP
	* ![Power Brace](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/9/9d/Brazal_recio.png/revision/latest?cb=20090701200903&format=webp) **Power Brace** : Adds +4 Evs in Attack
	* ![Power Belt](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/d/d4/Cinto_recio.png/revision/latest?cb=20090701202447&format=webp) **Power Belt** : Adds +4 EVs in Defense
	* ![Power Lens](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/9/91/Lente_recia.png/revision/latest?cb=20090702125257&format=webp) **Power Lens** : Adds +4 EVs in Special Attack
	* ![Power Band](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/7/76/Banda_recia.png/revision/latest?cb=20090701200836) **Power Band** : Adds +4 EVs in Special Defense
	* ![Power Anklet](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/es.pokemon/images/1/1f/Franja_recia.png/revision/latest?cb=20091010154647&format=webp) **Power Anklet** : Adds +4 EVs in Speed


###Calculations for EVs per Pokemon

Every Pokémon can give us 1, 2 or 3 EVs depending of the specie. For example, every rattata gives us 1 EV point and every Raticate gives us 2 EVs points.

####Base 1 point: 

* Pokérus / Macho Brace : 2 EVs
* Pokérus + Macho Brace : 4 EVs
* Pokérus + Power Item : 10 EVs

####Base 2 points:

* Pokérus / Macho Brace : 4 EVs
* Pokérus + Macho Brace : 8 EVs
* Pokérus + Power Item : 12 EVs

####Base 3 points:

* Pokérus / Macho Brace : 6 EVs
* Pokérus + Macho Brace : 12 EVs
* Pokérus + Power Item : 14 EVs

**The final result has to be multiplyed by 5 for horde encounters**.

##Stats

Every Pokémon has 6 stats which, along with the IVs and other stuff, define the final amount of HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed that the Pokémon has in each level.
